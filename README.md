# TabSwitcher 

TabSwitcher is my little experiment in building a Command-T like
extension for Chrome, through a plugin.

## What works 

- Triggering it with Control-\
- ESC to hide the UI
- Jumping to the best match with Enter
- Correct fuzzy matching algorithm 
- Highlight matches 

## TODO

- Get a shiny CSS 
- Go to any match by clicking on it or navigating with arrows ( or ctrl-j / ctrl-k ? )
- Get a config page to select an hotkey
